# buildvision

A new Augmented Reality Flutter project.

BuildVision aims to redefine the real estate industry by digitizing the process of visiting via Augmented Reality and 3D Models. In this application, a user may view their preffered buildings in real life around them and navigate through them to get the complete idea of it without the hassle of visiting.

Technologies used:
1) Flutter / DART
2) Google Model Viewer Plus
3) Blender
4) ARCore
5) Android Studio
